CryptoArbScanner is a cryptocurrency arbitrage scanner that analyzes the top cryptocurrencies via CoinGecko and compares them on different exchanges. It identifies possible arbitrage opportunities by calculating the percentage difference between the buying and selling prices on various exchanges.

Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Scanning: Code for scanning decentralized exchanges is broken we trying to fix lol
Real-time Updates: The scanner updates the data every 2 minutes to provide the latest arbitrage opportunities.
Web Interface: A web interface built with Dash to display the possible trades in a user-friendly manner.

How It Works
Arbitrage Calculation
The application calculates the profit from potential trades by comparing the prices on different exchanges. It considers only exchanges with high trust scores and targets USD or USDT as the trading pair.

Data Fetching
The application fetches coin data asynchronously using the CoinGecko API. It retrieves the ticker data for the top coins and calculates the possible trades based on the price differences.

Displaying Trades
The possible trades are displayed in a table on the web interface, showing the coin symbol, percentage difference, high exchange (buy), and low exchange (sell).
